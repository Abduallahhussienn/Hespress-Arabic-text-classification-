# Hespress-Arabic-text-classification-
## Overview
This notebook contains code for training a arabic text classification model that can predict the category of a given text input. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of text examples, where each example is labeled with a category. The notebook uses a variety of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to preprocess the text data and train the model.

## Dataset
Scraped over 10 000 stories from Hespress with details such as the author, the publishing date, the topic.
Also scraped all the comments associated with them which resulted in over 300K comments, this is very interesting for sentimental analysis, understanding the general opinion, and maybe even predicting election results, since with each comment a score by the readers is associated.
The dataset is preprocessed to remove stop words, punctuation, and other non-informative text, and the text is tokenized and converted to numerical features for training the model.

## Training Process
The training process consists of the following steps:

- Load the dataset and split it into training and validation sets.
- Preprocess the text data using various NLP techniques, such as tokenization.
- Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features using techniques such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF.
- Train the model on the training set using Logistic Regression. 
- Test the final trained model on the test set to evaluate its performance.
## Enhancements
To achieve better results, here are some enhancements that can be considered:

- Experiment with different models.
- Augment the dataset with additional labeled examples or generate synthetic examples using techniques such as data augmentation or back-translation.
- Fine-tune the model on a related task or domain to improve its performance on the target task or domain.
- Use an ensemble of models to combine the predictions of multiple models for better accuracy and robustness.
  
These are just a few examples of possible enhancements, and there may be other techniques and strategies that can be used depending on the specific task and data.
